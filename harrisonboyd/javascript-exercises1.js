//Problem 1

var firstName = "harrison";

//On line 3 I wrote a simple variable statement. I gave the variable a value of firstName and set it equal to a string of "harrison"


console.log(firstName);

//On line 8 I console.log the variable I declared on line 3 to the console. 

//Problem 2

var firstName = "Jack";
var lastName = "Smith";

function greet (first, last) {
  return "Good morning, " + first + " " + last
};

greet(firstName, lastName);

//Problem 3

// a:
var result = "The cat jumped over the moon";
//string

// b:
var result = 55 - 27;
//number

// c:
var result = 75 > 55;
//boolean

// d:
var data;
var result = data;
//undefined

// e:
var result = -6544.432;
//number

//Problem 4

// here's the first variable assignment you'll need
// you'll need to to assign the other 2 numbers yourself
var firstNumber = 50;
var secondNumber = 100;
var thirdNumber = 500

// add them together using + and store them in the sum variable
var sum = firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber;

// finally, print the sum
console.log(sum);

JS EXERCISE1-ANSWERS

1)	1.	Why should you always link external JavaScript files at the end of the <body> tag? 

Using external files instead of inline scripts is important in helping you run code to be used by multiple pages from one source, instead of being copied into multiple places. It saves time and effort rather than having to constantly write the <script> tag in for every bit of JS you import into your page.


2)Why is using comments important?

Comments allow you make notes along the way. They
make it easier for you and others to review your code. They can help you to test alternative code, meaning--if you wanted to hide something and try a new line of code, if it didn't work, you can always go back to your original.

3)List the 5 primitive types in JavaScript.
strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined


4)	1.	Once a variable has been defined, can its value be changed?  
a. yes 
b. no 
c. it depends 
Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, once for the life of any variable name in a document. You should not re-declare same variable twice.The value type of a variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.

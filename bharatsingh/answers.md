1. Why should you always link external JavaScript files at the end of the <body> tag?

	Javascript files should be placed at the end of the <body> tag so the HTML and CSS will be rendered before the Javascript. The static part of the webpage will load first without there being the unintentional issue of the Javascript file slowding down the process (especially if the Javascript file is large or the internet connection is either poor or slow).

2. Why is using comments important?

	Using comments is important for many reasons. One reason is for the developer writing the program to know what and why they are writing something for later reference. Other reasons could be to help brainstorm what they are thinking in case they or other developers look at their work. The general idea is to be cognizant of what's going on with a particular piece of code to avoid later confusion. 

3. List the 5 primitive types in JavaScript.

4. Once a variable has been defined, can its value be changed?
